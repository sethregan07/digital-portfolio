# Giants and Titans

Peter Phillips wrote Giants. He mapped who really controls the economy.

The answer shocked him. It will shock you.

$50 trillion. Maybe more.

This is not $20 trillion. This is bigger. Much bigger.

## The Real Numbers

The three biggest funds: BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street.

They control around $50 trillion combined. Maybe $60 trillion when you count everything.

They own shares in almost every major company. They sit on almost every major board.

This is not a market. This is an empire.

## The Military Connection

Here is what Phillips found: the giants connect to the military.

Defense contractors are owned by the giants. Lockheed Martin. Raytheon. General Dynamics.

When the giants invest, they fund war. When the giants vote, they support defense spending.

The connection is direct. The money flows both ways.

## The Lobbying Circles

The giants lobby. Heavily.

They spend billions on lobbying. They fund think tanks. They fund politicians.

The connection is simple: they pay for access. They pay for favorable rules.

This is not corruption. This is how the system works.

## The IMF and World Bank

The giants connect to international institutions.

The IMF lends to countries. The World Bank funds projects.

The giants often manage these funds. They invest the money. They profit from the debt.

When countries cannot pay, the giants benefit. They acquire assets. They gain influence.

## International Trade Organizations

The giants connect to WTO. To trade agreements. To international rules.

These rules benefit the giants. They open markets. They protect investments.

The connection is systematic. It is designed.

## Government Members Who Become Executives

Here is the key: people move between government and giants.

Secretary of Defense becomes board member at Lockheed. Former senator becomes consultant at BlackRock.

Treasury officials become hedge fund managers. This is the revolving door.

The same people shape policy. Then they profit from the results.

This is not hidden. It is documented. It is normal.

## The Full Picture

All of this connects.

The giants fund the military. The military protects the giants.

The giants lobby politicians. Politicians serve the giants.

The giants control international institutions. International institutions serve the giants.

Former government officials become executives. Executives become government officials.

This is one system. It is unified. It is powerful.

## What This Means

The economy is not controlled by markets. It is controlled by this network.

The network is $50+ trillion. It connects to military. It connects to government. It connects to international institutions.

This is the real power.

## Breaking The Network

Is breaking this network possible?

It is difficult. The connections are deep. The interests are aligned.

But awareness matters. Alternatives matter.

Community banks. Credit unions. Local investment. These are small but growing.

## Reflection Questions

1. How do giants connect to your life?
2. What government officials became executives?
3. What alternatives could you support?
4. How could the network change?
