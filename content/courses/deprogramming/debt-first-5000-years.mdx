# Debt: The First 5000 Years

You owe me. I owe you. Simple, right?

But what if that simple idea shaped entire civilizations? What if debt is not just about money—but about power?

David Graeber asked these questions. He was an anthropologist who joined Occupy Wall Street. He decided to research debt's history.

What he found changed everything.

## It Started With Tablets

5,000 years ago. Mesopotamia. The land between rivers.

People used clay tablets to track debts. Farmers borrowed seed. Merchants borrowed goods. Temples kept records.

Here is the secret: debt was personal. It connected people. You owed your neighbor. Your neighbor owed you.

Relationships mattered more than numbers.

## The Big Switch

Then something changed. States entered the picture.

Kings needed armies. Governments needed money. Banks needed customers.

Debt stopped being personal. It became political.

Now: if you owe money, you are not just in debt to a person. You are in debt to a system.

This matters.

## The Moral Trap

Here is how debt became psychological.

Religious traditions said: debt is sin. Christianity called for debt forgiveness. Islam banned interest. Hinduism locked people into castes through debt.

Why? Because guilt controls people.

If you owe money, you feel bad. You feel shame. You work jobs you hate. You sacrifice your dreams.

The system counts on this.

## How Debt Traps Work Today

Look around. Credit card offers everywhere.

The average American carries $6,000 in credit card debt. At 20% interest, that becomes $7,200 in one year.

This is not accident. Banks employ psychologists. They design cards to trap you.

The minimum payment trap. The revolving balance. The 20% interest.

You pay and pay. The debt never shrinks.

### Student Loans

Graduate with $100,000 debt.

The government takes your tax refunds. It garnishes your wages. You cannot escape even in bankruptcy.

### Medical Bills

Get sick in America. The bill arrives: $50,000. $100,000.

Medical debt is the top cause of bankruptcy in the US.

### The Credit Score

A three-digit number controls your life. Rent an apartment. Get a job. Buy a car.

Your credit score rewards obedience. It punishes deviation.

This is modern control.

## The Pattern Repeats

2008 financial crisis: banks crashed the economy.

Who paid? Taxpayers. Homeowners. Workers.

Who profited? Banks. Executives. Investors.

The pattern: privatize profits, socialize losses.

This is not free markets. This is rigged games.

## Breaking Free

But alternatives exist.

Time banks: one hour of your time equals one hour of anyone else's time.

Mutual aid: neighbors helping neighbors. No money changes hands.

Cooperative housing: residents own buildings together. No landlords.

These prove another world is possible.

## The Choice

Understanding debt history liberates.

Debt is not natural. It is political. It reflects power structures.

We can choose differently. We can build systems based on trust, not debt.

The first 5,000 years do not determine the next 5,000.

## Reflection Questions

1. What debts do you carry?
2. How did you feel when you first went into debt?
3. What would life look like without debt?
4. What alternatives could you try?

## Key Takeaways

- Debt existed before money
- Debt became a tool for control
- Modern debt traps use psychology
- The 2008 crisis shows who really benefits
- Alternatives exist

## Next Steps

Continue exploring how economic systems shape our lives. Each lesson reveals another layer of how we are conditioned.
