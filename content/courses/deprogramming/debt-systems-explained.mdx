# How Money Really Works

Banks create money. This is the secret no one talks about.

Every loan creates money. From nothing. This changes everything.

## The Creation Machine

You deposit $1,000. The bank keeps $100. Loans out $900.

That $900 becomes someone else's deposit. That person loans out $810.

$1,000 became $1,710. Magic.

This is fractional reserve banking. The foundation of the entire system.

Banks are not middlemen. They are creators.

## The Fed

The Federal Reserve controls everything.

Created in 1913. By bankers. For bankers.

Three jobs: set interest rates, control money supply, bank the government.

When rates fall, everyone borrows. When rates rise, everyone suffers.

The Fed claims to manage the economy. But it manages banks first.

## Wall Street

Stock markets are not rational. They are emotional.

Prices rise because people expect rises. Prices fall because people expect falls.

This is the bubble cycle. Over and over.

Hedge funds win. Regular investors lose. This is the game.

The game is fixed. Winners are decided before it starts.

## The Web

Banks lend to corporations. Corporations issue stocks. Stocks pay dividends.

Hedge funds bet both ways. Derivatives connect everything.

Everyone owes everyone. The web is complete.

One crash brings it all down.

## The 2008 Example

Banks made bad loans. Sold them. Bet against them.

When housing crashed, everyone collapsed.

Banks got bailouts. Executives got bonuses. Homeowners got evictions.

The pattern is clear. Privatize profits. Socialize losses.

## Breaking Free

Understanding the web reveals the exits.

Credit unions. Community banks. Local exchanges.

Build parallel systems. Reduce dependency. Create alternatives.

The system is not inevitable. It was designed. It can be redesigned.

## Reflection Questions

4. How could you reduce dependency?
