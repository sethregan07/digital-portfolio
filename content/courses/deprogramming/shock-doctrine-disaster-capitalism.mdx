# The Shock Doctrine

September 11, 1973. Chile.

A CIA-backed coup overthrows President Salvador Allende. General Augusto Pinochet takes power. Thousands die in the national stadium.

But the killing is only the beginning.

While the world watches the violence, something else happens. A group of economists arrives in Santiago. They carry a radical plan. Milton Friedman and the Chicago School have found their laboratory.

Chile becomes the first experiment in shock therapy.

## The core idea:

Crises create opportunities. Not for people. For profit.

The shock doctrine works in three stages:

Stage One: Crisis
Stage Two: Shock
Stage Three: Exploitation

War, natural disaster, terrorist attack, economic collapse. Anything that creates chaos and fear.

The chaos is the point. Order becomes the excuse.

## The Chicago Boys in Chile

Pinochet's regime brought in young economists trained at the University of Chicago. They called themselves "the Chicago Boys."

Their policies:

- Sell state companies to private owners
- Cut social programs
- Open markets to foreign corporations
- Crush labor unions
- Remove price controls

The Chilean economy initially collapsed. Unemployment soared. Poverty increased dramatically.

But for the wealthy and corporations? Record profits.

The model was clear: use violence to create shock, use shock to implement ideology.

## The Pattern Repeats

### Hurricane Katrina, 2005

New Orleans floods. 1,800 dead. The city is underwater.

Before the water recedes, corporations arrive with contracts. Public schools are closed. Public housing is demolished. The entire city is rebuilt for profit.

The poor, disproportionately Black residents, are priced out of their own city. Recovery becomes extraction.

### The Iraq War, 2003

Baghdad falls. Chaos ensues.

Corporations swoop in. Oil fields are privatized. Government services are contracted out. The entire economy is opened to foreign investment.

The war created shock. The shock created opportunity. The opportunity went to the already powerful.

### The 2008 Financial Crisis

Banks collapse. Markets crash. Fear everywhere.

Governments bail out banks with taxpayer money. But for ordinary people? Foreclosures continue. Jobs disappear. Austerity follows.

The crisis shocks the population. The shock justifies austerity. The rich get richer. The poor get poorer.

The pattern never breaks.

## Who Profits?

Follow the money:

- Multinational corporations acquire state assets for pennies
- Financial institutions receive bailouts while predatory practices continue
- Defense contractors profit from endless wars
- Private equity buys distressed assets at fire sale prices
- Insurance companies profit from disaster reconstruction

The shock creates consolidation. Every crisis makes the powerful more powerful.

## The Anti-Shock

But there is hope.

Not everyone accepts shock therapy. Some societies refuse the exploitation.

Bolivia faced water privatization. Mass protests succeeded. The contract was cancelled.

Iceland faced financial collapse. Instead of bailing out banks, they let them fail. They wrote a new constitution with public input.

South Korea faced IMF-imposed reforms in 1997. They invested in education and technology. Now they lead global industries.

The shock can be refused. But it requires consciousness before the shock takes hold.

## Recognizing the Pattern

Learn to see shock doctrine in action:

After any crisis, ask:

- Who profits from the response?
- What policies are being rushed through?
- Who is being excluded from recovery?
- What is being privatized?

Before the next crisis:

- Build community networks now
- Develop critical thinking skills
- Understand your rights
- Know your neighbors

Crises will come. But we can refuse the exploitation that follows.

## Breaking the Cycle

The shock doctrine depends on one thing: population passivity during trauma.

But trauma can become transformation.

When people organize, when they refuse division, when they demand accountability, the shock loses its power. The model only works if the population remains shocked.

Solidarity survives shock. Community survives shock. Resistance survives shock.

The question is not whether crises will come. The question is whether we will be ready to refuse the exploitation that follows.

## Reflection Questions

1. What crisis responses have you witnessed that followed the shock doctrine pattern?
2. How might communities prepare for future crises to avoid exploitation?
3. What role does media play in amplifying or reducing shock?
4. How can we maintain critical thinking during collective trauma?

## Key Takeaways

- Crises create opportunities for radical policy implementation
- The shock doctrine uses trauma to push through pro-corporate policies
- Chile, Katrina, Iraq, and 2008 all followed the same pattern
- Some societies have successfully refused shock therapy
- Awareness and community preparation can break the cycle

## Next Steps

Having explored how economic and political systems exploit crises, continue examining how consumer culture shapes our identities. The next lesson explores [Family and Cultural Programming](/projects/deprogramming/family-cultural-programming) to understand how we are conditioned from childhood.

The resistance starts with recognition. Once you see the pattern, you cannot unsee it.
