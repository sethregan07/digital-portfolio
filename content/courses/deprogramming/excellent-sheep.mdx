# Excellent Sheep

William Deresiewicz was an English professor at Yale. He saw thousands of graduates leave the Ivy League. He saw what they became. He was troubled.

He wrote Excellent Sheep to expose what elite education really does. The title refers to the graduates. They are excellent at being sheep. They follow. They conform. They succeed by external measures.

But they lack something essential. They lack critical thinking. They lack creativity. They lack fulfillment.

This is the hidden cost of elite education.

## The Ivy League Myth

American society believes in the Ivy League myth. These schools are supposed to produce leaders. They are supposed to nurture creativity. They are supposed to shape the future.

Deresiewicz spent years at Yale. He saw something different. The students were not learning to think. They were learning to perform.

The goal was not understanding. The goal was grades. The goal was credentials. The goal was acceptance into the next elite institution.

This creates a certain type of person. The excellent sheep.

## What Elite Education Teaches

Deresiewicz identifies what elite education actually teaches.

The first lesson is achievement. Students learn that success means external markers. Grades. Awards. Positions. These become the measure of worth.

The second lesson is compliance. Students learn to give teachers what they want. They learn to game the system. They learn to perform rather than think.

The third lesson is networking. Students learn that connections matter more than ideas. They learn to build relationships with the right people.

The fourth lesson is resume building. Students learn to accumulate credentials. Every activity must serve a purpose. Every experience must look good on paper.

The fifth lesson is avoidance. Students learn to avoid risk. They take safe courses. They choose safe topics. They never venture into uncertain territory.

## The Cost of Success

What do excellent sheep get? They get jobs on Wall Street. They get positions in top companies. They get acceptance to prestigious graduate schools.

But they also get something else. They get emptiness. They get confusion. They get unfulfilled lives.

Deresiewicz describes meeting graduates years later. They have succeeded by external measures. But they feel lost. They do not know what they believe. They do not know who they are.

This is the hidden cost. The sheep are excellent at being sheep. But they have lost something essential.

## What Is Missing

Deresiewicz identifies what elite education does not teach.

It does not teach critical thinking. Students learn to accept frameworks, not question them.

It does not teach creativity. Students learn to produce safe work, not innovative work.

It does not teach independence. Students learn to seek external validation, not internal direction.

It does not teach wisdom. Students learn to accumulate information, not understand life.

These absences create a specific type of person. Successful. Accomplished. And deeply unsatisfied.

## The System

The problem is systemic. It starts before college. High schools prepare students to compete for elite admissions. This means building the perfect resume. This means taking the right classes. This means performing the right activities.

College continues the process. The goal is not learning. The goal is credentials. The credential opens doors. The doors lead to success.

This success is measured externally. Salary. Status. Recognition.

The internal measure is ignored. Purpose. Meaning. Fulfillment.

## The Alternative

Deresiewicz suggests an alternative approach. Students should seek understanding, not credentials. They should take risks. They should follow their interests.

This is difficult in the current system. The system rewards compliance. It punishes deviation.

But some students escape. They find their own path. They develop critical thinking. They find fulfillment.

This requires courage. It requires willingness to reject the system. It requires defining success on their own terms.

## What Yale Teaches

Deresiewicz was specifically critical of Yale. But his observations apply to all elite institutions.

Yale teaches students to be clever. It does not teach them to be wise. It teaches them to succeed. It does not teach them to live well.

The faculty are complicit. They know the system is broken. But they participate anyway. They give good grades. They write recommendations for students they know are not learning.

This is the tragedy. Everyone knows. No one changes.

## Breaking Free

Is escape possible? Can elite education serve learning instead of credentials?

Deresiewicz suggests several approaches. Students should seek mentors who challenge them. They should take courses in fields they know nothing about. They should pursue questions that have no answers.

Most importantly, they should define success on their own terms. They should ask what they want from life, not what the system wants from them.

This is difficult. But it is possible.

## Reflection Questions

What did your education teach you about success? What values did it instill? What did it miss?

## Key Takeakes

- Elite education creates excellent sheep, not critical thinkers
- The goal is credentials, not understanding
- Success by external measures leads to internal emptiness
- Critical thinking and creativity are not nurtured
- Breaking free requires defining success on your own terms

## Next Steps

Continue exploring how education shapes lives. The debate about its purpose continues.

The excellent sheep succeed by every external measure. But they have lost something essential. They have lost the ability to think for themselves.
