# Capital as Power

Most people think: capital is money. Capital is machines. Capital is stuff that makes more stuff.

This is wrong.

Two economists asked a different question. Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler. They wrote "Capital as Power."

Their answer: capital is not about production. It is about power.

This changes everything.

## The Capital Calculation

Standard economics says: companies maximize profits. More profit means more capital. Capital grows through efficiency.

But look at the data. High profit companies sometimes shrink. Low profit companies sometimes grow.

This makes no sense. If capital is about profits, why the contradiction?

Nitzan and Bichler found the answer. Capital is not about profits. It is about power.

## The Differential Accumulation

Companies do not just accumulate. They accumulate differentially.

This means: relative power matters more than absolute power.

If your competitor grows faster, you are falling behind. Even if you grow.

This explains everything. Takeovers. Mergers. Strategic positioning.

The goal is not to grow. The goal is to grow faster than rivals.

This is why companies fight. Not for profit. For relative position.

## The Power View

When we see capital as power, things become clear.

Stock prices are not about future profits. They are about relative power.

Booms are not about efficiency. They are about capacity to dominate.

Crashes are not about miscalculation. They are about power shifts.

The economy is not a machine. It is a battlefield.

## The Capitalization

Everything gets capitalized. This means converted to present value.

Future income becomes today's price. Expected power becomes current stock value.

This is not prediction. This is storytelling. The market tells stories about power.

When stories change, prices change. This is not rationality. This is narrative.

## The Contesting

Power gets contested constantly.

Workers versus owners. Nations versus nations. Companies versus companies.

Every contest shapes capitalization. Winners gain power. Losers lose value.

The system is not stable. It is constant struggle.

## The Normalization

Power gets normalized. Made to seem natural.

We are told: this is efficient. This is optimal. This is the best possible world.

But it is not natural. It is designed. It serves certain interests.

When we see capital as power, we see through the normalization.

## Breaking the Frame

The question changes. Not "how to maximize profit?" Instead: "how to contest power?"

Alternatives emerge. Cooperatives. Unions. Movements.

These change relative power. They shift the battlefield.

This is not reform. It is recontestation.

## Reflection Questions

1. How do you see power in economic relationships?
2. Who has power over your work?
3. What alternatives could shift power?
4. How could you organize differently?

## Key Takeaways

- Capital is about power, not production
- Differential accumulation drives everything
- Stock prices reflect relative power
- The economy is constant contestation
- Alternatives contest power differently

## Next Steps

Continue exploring how economic systems maintain power. Each lesson reveals another layer.
