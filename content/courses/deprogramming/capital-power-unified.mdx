# The Unified System

Capital is power. This is the key.

But where does this power come from? How does it stay?

The answer: everything connects. Banks. Markets. States. Military. These are not separate. They are one system.

## The State

The state creates the rules. Property rights. Contracts. Enforcement.

Without the state, there is no capital. The state defines what can be owned. What can be sold. What can be accumulated.

This is why businesses need the state. Not against it. They need it.

But the state is not neutral. It serves certain interests. Those with power shape the rules.

## The Banks

Banks create money. This is their power.

They decide who gets credit. Who gets excluded. This is power.

Banks connect to the state. Central banks set interest rates. This controls everything.

Banks connect to markets. They trade. They speculate. They profit.

## The Markets

Markets are not free. They are structured.

Who can enter? What can be traded? What rules apply?

These are political decisions. Backed by state power.

Markets are arenas for differential accumulation. Winners take relative position. Losers fall behind.

## Wall Street

Wall Street is the center. The epicenter.

This is where capital is capitalized. Where power is priced.

Stock prices are not values. They are relative power positions.

When markets rise, some gain. When they fall, others gain. This is the game.

## The Military

The military protects the system. At home and abroad.

Overseas, military power opens markets. Secures resources. Installs friendly regimes.

This is not hidden. It is documented. The evidence is clear.

The military enables differential accumulation globally.

## The Connections

This is the unified system:

States create rules. Banks create money. Markets price power. Wall Street coordinates. Military enforces.

These are not separate. They are one system.

Each part strengthens the other. States protect banks. Banks fund markets. Markets reward states. Military secures everything.

## The Logic

Differential accumulation drives everything.

Corporations fight for relative position. They use states to create rules. They use banks to create credit. They use markets to price power.

The military opens territories. Secures resources. Removes obstacles.

This logic is consistent. It explains everything.

## The Integration

How do they integrate?

Through personnel. Bankers become regulators. Regulators become bankers. Executives move between sectors.

Through policy. Tax rules favor certain activities. Regulations shape competition. Subsidies direct investment.

Through ideology. All serve the system. All repeat the same story. Efficiency. Growth. Prosperity.

## The Cracks

The system is not perfect. Cracks appear.

Crises reveal the connections. 2008 showed: banks connected to markets connected to states connected to military.

The solution was always: save the system. Protect the powerful.

This reveals the logic. It is not about efficiency. It is about power.

## The Alternative

Understanding the unified system reveals alternatives.

Different integration is possible. Different rules. Different priorities.

The question is not whether to integrate. The question is who integrates. For whom.

## Reflection Questions

1. How do these systems connect in your life?
2. Who benefits from the current integration?
3. What different integration could look like?
4. How could you participate differently?

## Key Takeaways

- States, banks, markets, Wall Street, and military form one system
- Differential accumulation drives the integration
- The military enables global power
- Integration serves certain interests
- Different integration is possible
