# Capital and Contestation

Capital is power. Power is contested.

This is the hidden story. The economy is not a machine. It is a battlefield.

Everyone fights. Workers. Owners. Nations. Companies.

The fight is never over.

## The Class Struggle

Workers versus owners. This is the classic fight.

Workers want higher wages. Owners want lower costs.

Who wins? It shifts over time.

In the 1950s, workers gained power. Unions were strong. Wages grew.

In the 1980s, owners gained power. Unions declined. Inequality rose.

This is not automatic. It is contestation.

## The Industry Fights

Companies fight companies. For market share. For dominance.

Mergers increase power. Takeovers eliminate rivals.

The goal: dominate rivals. Grow faster than competitors.

This is differential accumulation in action.

## The Global Battles

Nations fight nations. Trade wars. Currency wars.

America versus China. Europe versus America.

Who wins? Depends on power. Depends on alliances.

The battlefield is global.

## The Financial Front

Banks fight for deposits. Funds fight for returns.

High frequency traders win. Regular investors lose.

Technology changes the fighting. Speed matters.

## The Current Phase

Right now, several fights matter:

Tech versus traditional. Globalists versus nationalists. Workers versus automation.

Each fight shapes capitalization. Each outcome shifts power.

## The Breaking Points

Crises change fights. recessions. Pandemics. Wars.

In crises, some gain. Others lose.

2020 pandemic: tech gained. Traditional lost. This is differential accumulation.

## The Resistance

Workers organize. Communities resist. Movements emerge.

These fights shift power. They change outcomes.

The system is not fixed. It is being contested constantly.

## The Possibilities

What fights could we start?

Cooperatives shift ownership. Unions shift wages. Movements shift priorities.

These change relative power. They change the game.
