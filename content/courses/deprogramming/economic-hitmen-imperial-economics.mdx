# Economic Hitmen and Imperial Economics

A hotel room in Jakarta. 1978. A young economist lies awake, unable to sleep.

Something is wrong with the "development project" just pitched to Indonesian leaders. The contracts will go to American corporations. The oil will flow to Western markets. The highway they don't need comes with debt they cannot repay.

That night, everything changed.

The truth emerged: the World Bank, IMF, and "development aid" are not always what they seem. Something far more sinister hides beneath the surface of global finance.

## The Hidden Machine

Economic hit men operate in shadows. Their job: convince developing nations to accept massive loans for infrastructure projects.

The projects look legitimate. Highways, power plants, airports. Development on an impossible scale.

But the real purpose?

Debt dependencies that serve multinational corporations and global powers. The four tools of the trade:

Modern colonialism without the military. Same result, different method.

## The Trap Unfolds

### Phase One: The Seduction

A developing nation dreams of modernization. Their president wants highways, airports, power plants.

Enter the economic hit man with promises of easy financing.

"Your country has so much potential. We'll help you achieve it."

The flattery works. The vision is intoxicating. Who rejects progress?

### Phase Two: The Lock-In

The loans arrive with conditions. Structural adjustment programs demand:

- Privatization of state-owned enterprises
- Market opening to foreign competition
- Austerity cuts to social programs
- Currency manipulation

Countries cannot repay without more loans. More loans mean more conditions. A mathematical prison.

### Phase Three: The Extraction

Once locked in, extraction begins:

- Multinational corporations take natural resources
- Local businesses cannot compete
- Talent drains to wealthier nations
- Citizens bear the cost through austerity

Ecuador accepted billions in loans, gave away oil rights. Despite wealth beneath the ground, poverty increased. Money flows out, not in.

Indonesia received "development" loans. Local farmers could not compete with subsidized agribusiness. Traditional agriculture collapsed.

Nigeria should be prosperous from oil. Instead, corporations extract billions while citizens remain in poverty. The pattern is deliberate.

## The Enforcers

### International Monetary Fund

The IMF is the enforcer. When countries cannot pay, the IMF offers "rescue packages."

Conditions require:

- Healthcare and education cuts
- Interest rate increases that kill local businesses
- Public asset sales to foreign investors
- Removal of price controls and subsidies

Rich countries grow richer. Poor countries grow poorer. Not accident. Design.

### World Bank

Funds "development projects." But scrutiny reveals:

- Contracts go to multinational corporations from donor countries
- Environmental impacts ignored
- Countries lose control over resources
- Consultants from wealthy nations receive generous fees

### World Trade Organization

Enforces trade rules that benefit wealthy nations:

- Pharmaceutical patents allow companies to charge anything
- Agricultural subsidies from rich countries undercut exports
- Investor rights allow corporations to sue governments

## The Human Cost

This is not abstract economics. Real lives destroyed.

Greece accepted IMF conditions. Healthcare spending cuts linked to thousands of preventable deaths. Elderly died from treatable conditions. Children went hungry.

Nigeria displaced farming communities for oil extraction. Oil wealth leaves in corporate profits. Farmers lose land and livelihoods.

Sub-Saharan Africa forced to export food rather than feed own people. When droughts hit, no buffer existed. Millions faced famine.

The calculation is direct: debt to wealthy nations equals death for poor ones.

## Countries That Said No

Not every nation fell for the trap.

Cuba rejected IMF loans. Developed independent healthcare and education systems. Despite US embargoes, Cuban doctors are world-renowned.

Costa Rica invested in education over extraction. Central America's highest literacy rate. Thriving eco-tourism industry.

Bolivia renegotiated water contracts when companies gouged profits. Took back control of vital resources.

Bhutan measures success by Gross National Happiness, not GDP. Protects environment over growth.

These nations are not perfect. But another path exists.

## Practical Steps

This might seem like "big picture" stuff. Nothing personal people can do.

But systems change when enough people see clearly.

### Follow the Supply Chain

Before buying anything, ask:

- Where was it made?
- Who extracted raw materials?
- What corporations profited?
- What countries involved in the supply chain?

The global web of extraction becomes visible.

### Support Ethical Business

Purchasing power is a vote. Choose companies that:

- Pay fair wages
- Use sustainable materials
- Do not exploit developing nations

### Demand Policy Change

Write to representatives. Support debt justice organizations. Demand governments stop conditioning aid on harmful policies.

### Educate Others

Most people do not know how this system works. Share knowledge. Start conversations. Awareness precedes change.

## The Path Forward

Understanding economic imperialism is unsettling. It raises uncomfortable questions about consumption and complicity.

But hope exists.

Systems change when enough people refuse to play along. The Berlin Wall fell because people stopped believing in it. Apartheid ended because the world saw through it.

This system can change too.

The question is not whether it will. The question is whether we will be part of the change.

## Reflection Questions

1. How has personal consumption connected you to global economic systems?
2. What would "decolonizing" the economy mean for your country?
3. How might life change if the full cost of everyday products was understood?
4. What single action could support economic justice?

## Key Takeaways

- Economic hit men use debt and development schemes to create dependencies serving wealthy nations
- IMF, World Bank, and WTO enforce policies keeping developing nations in chains
- Corporate imperialism extracts wealth while preventing genuine development
- Some countries successfully resisted, proving another path exists
- Personal awareness and action contribute to systemic change

## Next Steps

Having explored how economic systems create dependency, continue with [Family and Cultural Programming](/projects/deprogramming/family-cultural-programming) to examine personal dimensions of economic conditioning.
