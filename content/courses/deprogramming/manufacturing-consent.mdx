# Manufacturing Consent

Turn on the news. Read a headline. Ask: who benefits?

Noam Chomsky asked this question for decades. With Edward Herman, he wrote a book that changed everything.

The title: Manufacturing Consent. The meaning: the powerful control what you think.

## The Five Filters

Chomsky and Herman identified five filters. These filters shape every story.

**Filter one: ownership.** Who owns the media?

Most media is owned by corporations. Corporations have interests. These interests shape coverage.

The owner decides what is news. The owner decides what is not.

**Filter two: advertising.** Who pays?

Media needs money. Advertisers provide it. But advertisers have products. They do not want controversial content.

The advertiser decides what you see. The advertiser decides what is acceptable.

**Filter three: sourcing.** Where do stories come from?

Journalists cannot be everywhere. They rely on official sources. Government. Corporations. Experts.

These sources have agendas. They provide information that serves them.

**Filter four: flak.** What gets punished?

When media publishes something powerful do not like, they complain. They pressure. They threaten.

This is flak. Media avoids flak. They self-censor.

**Filter five: anti-communism.** The fear factor.

During the Cold War, anti-communism justified anything. Dissent was treason. Criticism was un-American.

This filter is less powerful now. But the mechanism remains.

Fear sells. Fear controls.

## The Propaganda Model

Combine all five filters. What do you get?

A system that manufactures consent.

The powerful do not need to ban ideas. They just need to control what gets discussed. How it gets discussed. What is acceptable.

This is not conspiracy. This is structure.

## The News You Don't See

Here is the test: what stories are missing?

Major protests in friendly countries. Corporate crimes. Government abuses by allies.

These stories do not fit the filters. They do not get coverage.

The propaganda model explains why.

## The Choice

Is all media propaganda? No.

But the filters are real. The incentives are real. Understanding this is power.

The next time you read news, ask: who owns this? Who advertises here? Where did this source come from?

This is deprogramming. This is seeing behind the curtain.

## Reflection Questions

1. What news sources do you use? Who owns them?
2. What stories have you not seen recently? Why?
3. How does advertising affect what you read?

## Key Takeaways
