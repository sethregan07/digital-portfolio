# The Underground History of American Education & Deschooling Society

John Taylor Gatto and Ivan Illich wrote about the same problem from different angles. Gatto was an American teacher. Illich was an Austrian philosopher. Both reached the same conclusion. Schools are not working. They never have.

Gatto wrote The Underground History of American Education. He exposed what American schools really do. Illich wrote Deschooling Society. He called for the abolition of compulsory schooling.

Together, they offer a radical critique. Education and schooling are not the same thing. Schools may actually prevent learning.

## Gatto's Underground History

Gatto spent thirty years teaching in New York City. He won awards. He was considered excellent. And he was deeply troubled.

He began to ask questions. What do schools actually teach? Why does it take so long? Why is most of what is learned forgotten?

His research led him to a disturbing conclusion. American schools were not designed to educate. They were designed to control.

He traced the history. In the late 1800s, business leaders worried about unrest. Workers were becoming educated. They were reading dangerous ideas. They were organizing.

The solution was compulsory schooling. Put children in buildings for many hours each day. Teach them to be punctual. Teach them to follow rules. Teach them to seek approval.

This was not about education. It was about control.

## The Hidden Curriculum

Gatto identified what he called the hidden curriculum. This is what schools really teach, beyond the official subjects.

The first lesson is confusion. School teaches that everything is fragmented. Nothing connects. Each subject is separate. Each day is divided into periods. This keeps students dependent on the system to make sense of things.

The second lesson is class position. Some students are labeled smart. Some are labeled slow. This labels stick. They become self-fulfilling. Students learn their place in the hierarchy.

The third lesson is emotional dependency. Students learn to look to teachers for approval. They learn to perform emotions they do not feel. They learn to seek external validation.

The fourth lesson is intellectual dependency. Students learn they cannot trust their own minds. They must consult experts. They must look to authorities for answers.

The fifth lesson is psychological self-mutilation. Students learn to suppress their natural curiosity. They learn that questions are annoying. They learn that exploration is wasteful.

The sixth lesson is provisional self-esteem. Students learn their worth depends on external evaluation. Test scores. Grades. Teacher comments.

The seventh lesson is that one cannot hide. Students learn they are always being watched. Being evaluated. Being compared.

These lessons create ideal workers. Ideal consumers. Ideal citizens.

## Illich's Deschooling Society

Ivan Illich wrote Deschooling Society in 1971. He went further than Gatto. He called for the abolition of schools, not just reform.

Illich argued that schools are inherently destructive. They create dependencies. They devalue learning. They justify inequality.

Consider what schools do. They grant credentials. These credentials determine who gets good jobs. But the credentials do not measure learning. They measure compliance. They measure ability to jump through hoops.

This creates a monopoly on opportunity. Those who finish school get jobs. Those who do not are excluded. The school credential becomes more important than what was learned.

Illich called this the ritualization of schooling. The process matters more than the outcome. Students learn to perform the ritual. They learn to get good grades. They learn to please teachers. This has nothing to do with genuine learning.

## The Crisis of Education

Both Gatto and Illich see a crisis. Schools are not educating. They are manufacturing compliance.

Gatto documents how American schools have failed. Literacy has not improved in decades. Students cannot think critically. They cannot solve problems.

Illich sees this as a global phenomenon. Modern schools have spread worldwide. But the results are the same everywhere. Schools create dependencies. They create inequalities. They do not create learning.

The crisis is not about funding. It is not about curriculum. It is not about teachers. It is about the very concept of compulsory schooling.

## The Alternative

What is the alternative to schools?

Gatto suggests looking at history. Before compulsory schooling, people learned. They learned from families. From communities. From apprenticeships. From reading. From life.

This does not mean going back to the past. It means recognizing that schools are not the only way to learn.

Illich proposed learning webs. These are networks that connect those who want to learn with those who want to teach. No credentials. No grades. No compulsory attendance.

Learning becomes voluntary. It becomes meaningful. It becomes lifelong.

This is radical. It challenges everything we assume about education.

## The Resistance

Both Gatto and Illich faced resistance. Gatto was attacked by the education establishment. His ideas were too critical. Too dangerous.

Illich was called an anarchist. His ideas were too radical. Too threatening.

But their work continues to inspire. Homeschooling has grown. Unschooling has emerged. Learning alternatives have multiplied.

Some parents reject schools entirely. They choose to educate their children differently. They trust learning to happen naturally.

This is controversial. But it is growing.

## What Is Education

Gatto and Illich force us to ask fundamental questions. What is education? Is it the same as schooling?

Education is learning. It is growth. It is development. It can happen anywhere.

Schooling is something else. It is compulsory attendance. It is age-based grouping. It is credentialing.

These are not the same. Schools may help education. But they may also hinder it.

Recognizing this difference is essential. Only then can we create something better.

## Reflection Questions

What did school really teach you? What did you learn outside of school? What would learning look like without schools?

## Key Takeaways

- Compulsory schooling was designed for control, not education
- The hidden curriculum teaches compliance, not knowledge
- Schools create dependencies and devalue learning
- Alternatives are possible but face resistance
- Education and schooling are not the same

## Next Steps

The next step is creating a new section dedicated to education. All education-related articles will be gathered there for easier navigation.

Schools were never designed to educate. They were designed to control. Recognizing this is the first step toward creating something better.
